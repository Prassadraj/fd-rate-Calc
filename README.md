# fd-rate-Calc
This JavaScript code calculates and displays the fixed deposit interest rate based on the user-entered tenure (in years) and updates the result in an HTML element with the id "result." The interest rates are predefined for different tenure ranges: 5.8% for <3 years, 6.5% for 3-6 years, 6.8% for 7-9 years, and 7% for 10+ years.
